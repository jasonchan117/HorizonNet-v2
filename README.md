# HorizonNet-v2

This is the implementation of my CSI 5139F  Convolutional Neural Networks in Computer Vision Fall 2020 project : **Manhattan Line Map can improve performance in 3D Room Layout Reconstruction**

* Noticed that the package **./horizonnet_master/** contains methods from original HorizonNet implementation, the license is also included.
